# Telnyx WebRTC SIP JavaScript library

![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@telnyx/rtc-sipjs)

The Telnyx SIP-based WebRTC JS library powers up your web application with the ability to make and receive phone calls directly in the browser.

Check out the library in action in [this web dialer demo](https://webrtc.telnyx.com/).

*Looking for more WebRTC features, JSON-RPC support or need to quickly get spun up with a React app?  Telnyx also has a robust [WebRTC SDK](https://github.com/team-telnyx/webrtc) available as a separate npm module.*
